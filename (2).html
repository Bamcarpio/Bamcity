            <h3> Climate and Weather </h3>
        <p> Just like the rest of the Philippines, Baguio has two seasons, the dry season and the wet season. However, Baguio weather does not vary drastically in terms of monthly average temperature compared to the rest of the country.

The dry summer season has an average daily high temperature of 23°C and a low of 15°C, while the wet season has an average daily high temperature of 22°C and a low of 13 °C. Thanks to the high elevation of Baguio, the temperature difference throughout the year is minimal.

However, it’s a different story when it comes to rainfall. The amount of rain Baguio receives throughout the year varies significantly. The dry months start in November and last through May.

January receives the least amount of rainfall and has the least chance of rain. On the other hand, the rainy season starts in June and lasts through early October, with August as the rainiest month.

Unlike island destinations in the Philippines, the rainy season won’t stop you from enjoying Baguio attractions to the fullest. Although it gets even colder than usual during the rainy months, it can easily be remedied by bringing thicker cold-weather clothing.

Here's an overview of the average monthly Baguio temperature and rainfall:</p>

Unlike the rest of the Philippines, Baguio is exceptionally cold at any time of the year − even during the summer season!  Although the Philippines does not technically have winter, you will want to wear and pack winter clothes when visiting Baguio.

Bring a thick jacket or sweater, and perhaps a pair of gloves, a bonnet, and a scarf. Wear warm and thick clothes made of wool or fleece, and go with sneakers instead of open-toe footwear. 

If you plan to go around Baguio during the early hours of the morning or late in the evening, don’t be afraid to layer on. It is notably colder in the morning and evening. During the noontime, you can get away with a scarf or a light jacket, − especially if you’ll be walking around a lot.</P>
